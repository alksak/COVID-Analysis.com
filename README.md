# COVID-19 Projections with System Dynamics

## Introduction
We are researchers and engineers from Greece. We decided to make a good use of our expertise in Computer Science, Data Analysis and Scientific Modelling in order to contribute to the ongoing research about COVID-19. We are not doctors neither epidemiologists.
You can find more information about our team members on our social media accounts. Feel free to contact us directly.

## Our Goal
Our goal is to provide insights and projections about the progression of coronavirus pandemic in a fast, clean and understandable way. We have developed a publicly available tool that helps everyone to comprehend the huge amount of information and numbers. This is necessary because peopleâ€™s behavior is the main lever for controlling the outcome of the disease.

## This Repo
Here are the results of COVID-Analysis.com project. The projection files are in JSON format, including Date in Datetime format. The files are named by the Country and the date of projection. Example: Greece_pred_29_3_2020.json which means that this projection has not incorporated the data from and after April 29th, 2020. Every new projection is dumped as a different file with the above format.

You can read more about our model [here](https://covid-analysis.com/p/covid19-projection-model).

The project is self-funded. Your contribution is important for the operating expenses of this site and for coffee, our basic fuel. Every donation will help us continue this effort. [Donate](https://covid-analysis.com/donate)
